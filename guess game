create if staements for each difficulty
choose a random number to be the answer
create while loops for each of them so that it will break when the number is guessed correctly
have them choose a number
if they choose not a number or one outside the range have an error message and restart asking them the question
add a variable that counts how many guesses it took
create if statements so if it is lower say it is lower and if it is higher say it is higher
if they guess correctly break the loop and congradulate them
ask them if they would like to play again
if they say yes then restart if they say no then tell them bye and end the program
