import random
prompt the user for their name
greet them by name
create a while loop so that as long as they answer yes to the "play again?" question it will continue
ask the user what difficulty they would like (easy is 1-10, medium is 1-50, and hard is 1-100)
create if staements for each difficulty
choose a random number to be the answer
create while loops for each of them so that it will break when the number is guessed correctly
have them choose a number
if they choose not a number or one outside the range have an error message and restart asking them the question
add a variable that counts how many guesses it took
create if statements so if it is lower say it is lower and if it is higher say it is higher
if they guess correctly break the loop and congradulate them
ask them if they would like to play again
if they say yes then restart if they say no then tell them bye and end the program
